## About Me

I’m **Ritvik Singh**, a Cyber Security Analyst with hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, threat detection, and digital forensics. I focus on ethically identifying weaknesses and strengthening systems with practical, real-world security methods.

### What I’m Working On
- Web, network, and mobile security testing  
- SIEM and SOC operations  
- Threat intelligence and incident response  
- Defensive and offensive security tooling  

### What Drives Me
I enjoy solving complex security challenges, exploring exploit development, and creating or participating in CTF challenges. Continuous learning and improvement are central to my approach.

### Beyond Cybersecurity
I spend time reading philosophy, cybersecurity research, and thought-provoking literature. I also play FPS games to enhance strategy, focus, and team coordination.

### My Approach
Automation is useful, but deep understanding matters more. If the tools fail, I rely on analysis, creativity, and experience.

### Goal
To grow into a top-tier cybersecurity specialist skilled at countering advanced threats, securing large infrastructures, and contributing to innovative security solutions.
